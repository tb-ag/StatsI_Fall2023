###Question 1###
## I install the packages and check the dataset as instructed##
install.packages("car")
library(car)
data(Prestige)
help(Prestige)

##a. Create a new variable professional by recoding the variable type so that 
#professionals are coded as 1, and blue and white collar workers are coded as 0 
#(Hint: ifelse).####

Prestige$professional = ifelse(Prestige$type == "prof", 1, 0)
#I use the ifelse function to assign 1 to people coded as professionals under 
#the type column and #0 for anyone else (white collars and blue collars)
#I didn't touch the NAs since they seem to be irrelevant per the instructions.

##b. Run a linear model with prestige as an outcome and income, professional, 
###and the interaction of the two as predictors.###
l_model = lm(prestige ~ income + professional + income:professional,
             data = Prestige)
#I prepared the model.income:professional shows the interaction term between the two.
summary(l_model)
#Since, the model includes three variables, I research a bit and use ggplot
# to plot it. I ran into errors and used ChatGPT to fix the code.
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-linear-regression-using-ggplot2-in-r/
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Prestige, aes(x = income, y = prestige)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(professional))) +  # Add points with color based on professional status
  geom_smooth(data = subset(Prestige, professional == 1), 
              method = "lm", 
              formula = y ~ x, 
              se = FALSE, 
              color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(data = subset(Prestige, professional == 0), 
              method = "lm", 
              formula = y ~ x, 
              se = FALSE, 
              color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Income",
       y = "Prestige",
       color = "Professional Status",
       title = "Prestige vs. Income by Professional Status") +
  theme_minimal()

##c. Write the prediction equation based on the result.###
#first I need the coefficients
coef_l_model <- coef(l_model)
#I extract the intercept and slopes for income, professional, and their interaction
intercept <- coef_l_model[1]
slope_income <- coef_l_model[2]
slope_professional <- coef_l_model[3]
slope_interaction <- coef_l_model[4]
#I define the prediction equation with support from ChatGPT as I encountered many errors:
prediction_equation <- function(income, professional) {
  prestige_prediction = intercept + slope_income * income + slope_professional * professional + slope_interaction * income * professional
  return(prestige_prediction)
}

##d. Interpret the coefficient for income.###
#I check the income coefficient:
income_coefficient <- coef_l_model["income"]
print(income_coefficient)
#It is 0.003170909, meaning for each additional unit of income, the prestige score
#is expected to increase by approximately 0.003170909 units, holding all other 
#factors constant in the model.

##e. Interpret the coefficient for professional.###
#I do the same for professional.
professional_coefficient <- coef_l_model["professional"]
print(professional_coefficient)
#The coefficient is 37.78128, meaning being in a professional occupation as opposed 
#to being blue-collar or white-collar s associated with an increase of approximately
#37.78 units in the prestige score, holding all other factors constant in the model.

##f. What is the effect of a $1,000 increase in income on prestige score for 
##professional occupations? In other words, we are interested in the marginal effect
##of income when the variable professional takes the value of 1. Calculate the change
##in ^y associated with a $1,000 increase in income based on your answer for (c)###
#In order to use my equation from c, I will calculate two separate predictions
#that have a $1000 increase between them for professionals. Then I'd subtract them
#to find the change in prestige:
predicted_prestige1 = prediction_equation(5000, 1)
predicted_prestige2 = prediction_equation(6000, 1)
change_in_prestige = predicted_prestige2 - predicted_prestige1
print(change_in_prestige)
#an income increase of $1,000 for professional occupations increase the prestige
#score by 0.8452

##g. What is the effect of changing one's occupations from non-professional to 
##professional when her income is $6,000? We are interested in the marginal 
##effect of professional jobs when the variable income takes the value of 6#000.
##Calculate the change in any based on your answer for (c).###
#I need to calculate the predicted prestige for both scenarios (non-professional 
#and professional) at the specified income level and then find the difference.
# I calculate the predicted prestige for a non-professional occupation at $6,000
predicted_prestige_nonpf = prediction_equation(6000, 0)

# I do the same for professionals at $6,000
predicted_prestige_pf = prediction_equation(6000, 1)

# I calculate the change in prestige due to changing occupation from nonpf to pf
change_in_prestige2 = predicted_prestige_pf - predicted_prestige_nonpf

# Print the change in prestige
print(change_in_prestige2)
#It is 23.82701. In other words, changing one's occupation from nonpf to pf when
#their income is $6000 increases that person"s prestige points by 23.82703


###Question 2###

##a. Use the results from a linear regression to determine whether having these 
## yard signs in a precinct affects vote share (e.g., conduct a hypothesis test with
## alpha = :05)####
#I start by adding the coefficient and standard error for lawn signs from the table
#because I'd need to performa t-test to see if the coefficient is significantly
#different from zero to conduct the hypothesis test. This way I can tell if the 
#signs have an effect. My null hypothesis is the true coefficient equals to zero,
#meaning the signs do not have an effect on voting. My alternative hypothesis is 
#that it #doesn't equal to zero and they do not lack an effect.
coef_lawn_signs <- 0.042
se_lawn_signs <- 0.016
#t value is the coefficients divided by standard error
t_value_lawn_signs <- coef_lawn_signs / se_lawn_signs
#I calculate the degrees of freedom
df <- 131 - 3 #total parameters are 131 and we have 3 parameters
#Since I do not have a specific direction of effect regarding sign's effectiveness,
#(we do not know if it affects positively or negatively), I make a two-tailed
#t test with 95% confidence. I use 0.975 because it is a two-tailed test.
critical_t <- qt(0.975, df)
#I check if the absolute t-value is greater than the critical t-value
abs(t_value_lawn_signs) > critical_t
#Yes, it is greater than the critical t-value, meaning I can reject the null
#hypothesis. In other words, the signs do not lack an effect on voting. Having a 
#lawn sign have statistically significant effect on the vote share for Cuccinelli.

##(b) Use the results to determine whether being next to precincts with these yard signs
#affects vote share (e.g., conduct a hypothesis test with05).##
#I do the same as a for b since the only difference is being adjacent to a lawn
#sign as opposed to having it on your own lawn.
coef_adjacent_signs <- 0.042
se_adjacent_signs <- 0.013
#I calculate the t-value
t_value_adjacent_signs <- coef_adjacent_signs / se_adjacent_signs
#again, I do a two-tailed test and I already have the degrees of freedom
critical_t_adjacent <- qt(0.975, df)
abs(t_value_adjacent_signs) > critical_t_adjacent
#It is TRUE, meaning I can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, being 
#adjacent to a lawn sign have statistically significant effect on the vote share 
#for Cuccinelli.

## (c) Interpret the coefficient for the constant term substantively.##
#The coefficient is 0.302. It represents the expected baseline support for 
#Cuccinelli when there are no law signs (when all independent variables are zero)
#In other words Cucccinelli is expected to have 30.2% baseline support without
#any lawn signs per this model.

## (d) Evaluate the model fit for this regression. What does this tell us about the 
##importance of yard signs versus other factors that are not modeled?##
#RÂ² is 0.094. It means that 9.4% if the variability in Cuccinelli's vote share
#is explained by the model(yard signs and adjacency of yard signs). Yard signs have
#a statistically significant effect but their impact on the overall vote share
#is limited when compared to all factors that could potentially influence the outcome.
#there are likely many other factors like campaigns, candidate performance,
#conditions related to issues associated with candidates, etc. The statistical 
#significance of the yard signs does not necessarily mean a significant effect
#on the wider vote share.
